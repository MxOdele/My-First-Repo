# My-First-Repo
My First Repo for 1.2 Activities

Adding some text by opening the README.md through the 'explorer' command in
Git Bash. Now I will save this file.

Now I am adding some new text. I have established a new local Branch. This text
is being saved to the local README.md on the new Branch 'new-branch'. Now I
will savve this file.
